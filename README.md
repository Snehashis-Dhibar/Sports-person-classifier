# Sports-person-classifier

This project aims to classify sports persons based on input images using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a popular machine learning algorithm. The SVM algorithm is a powerful tool for binary and multiclass classification tasks, and in this project, we utilize it to categorize sports persons into different classes based on their images.




## Project Overview
In this project, we have developed a machine learning model that can predict the sport category of a given sports person's image. The SVM algorithm is employed to learn patterns and features from the images, and the trained model is capable of classifying the input images into predefined sports categories.
